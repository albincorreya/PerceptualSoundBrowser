# Perceptual Sound Browser

Experimental prototype of a sound browser where you can browse sound effect collections by specifying perceptual acoustical qualities of sound such as brightness, depth, hardness and roughness.

This project was developed as a part of my thesis for Masters' in Sound and Music Computing at Music Technology Group, Barcelona. You can find a detailed explanation of the project here.

This project uses the timbral sound models in the following repo https://github.com/AudioCommons/timbral_models which was developed as a part of AudioCommons initiative.
